Define:
- n: Number of periods for calculating breakout
- upper_threshold: Upper threshold for breakout above resistance
- lower_threshold: Lower threshold for breakout below support

Algorithm:
1. Loop:
   Loop indefinitely:
      a. Get historical prices:
         historical_prices = GetHistoricalPrices(n)

      b. Calculate breakout levels:
         resistance = CalculateResistance(historical_prices)
         support = CalculateSupport(historical_prices)

      c. Get the current price:
         current_price = GetCurrentPrice()

      d. Generate trading signals:
         If current_price > resistance + upper_threshold:
            GenerateBuySignal()
         Else if current_price < support - lower_threshold:
            GenerateSellSignal()

      e. Repeat the loop

2. End

Subroutine GetHistoricalPrices(n):
1. Retrieve historical price data for the past n periods from the trading platform or data provider
2. Return the historical prices as an array

Subroutine CalculateResistance(prices):
1. Determine the highest price within the historical prices:
   resistance = Max(prices)

2. Return the resistance level

Subroutine CalculateSupport(prices):
1. Determine the lowest price within the historical prices:
   support = Min(prices)

2. Return the support level

Subroutine GetCurrentPrice():
1. Retrieve the current price from the trading platform or data provider
2. Return the current price

Subroutine GenerateBuySignal():
1. Execute the buy trade based on your trading platform's API or logic
2. Add appropriate risk management measures (position sizing, stop-loss, etc.)
3. Return

Subroutine GenerateSellSignal():
1. Execute the sell trade based on your trading platform's API or logic
2. Add appropriate risk management measures (position sizing, stop-loss, etc.)
3. Return
