Define:
- n: Number of periods for calculating the mean
- upper_threshold: Upper threshold for overbought conditions
- lower_threshold: Lower threshold for oversold conditions

Algorithm:
1. Calculate the mean:
   mean = CalculateMean(n)

2. Loop:
   Loop indefinitely:
      a. Get the current price:
         current_price = GetPrice()

      b. Calculate the deviation:
         deviation = current_price - mean

      c. Generate trading signals:
         If deviation > upper_threshold:
            GenerateSellSignal()
         Else if deviation < lower_threshold:
            GenerateBuySignal()

      d. Repeat the loop

3. End

Subroutine CalculateMean(n):
1. Initialize an empty array, prices
2. Loop n times:
      a. Get the historical price at each period
      b. Add the price to the prices array
3. Calculate the mean as the sum of all prices divided by n
4. Return the mean

Subroutine GetPrice():
1. Retrieve the current price from the trading platform or data provider
2. Return the current price

Subroutine GenerateBuySignal():
1. Execute the buy trade based on your trading platform's API or logic
2. Add appropriate risk management measures (position sizing, stop-loss, etc.)
3. Return

Subroutine GenerateSellSignal():
1. Execute the sell trade based on your trading platform's API or logic
2. Add appropriate risk management measures (position sizing, stop-loss, etc.)
3. Return
