Define:
- n: Number of periods for calculating volatility
- upper_threshold: Upper threshold for determining high volatility
- lower_threshold: Lower threshold for determining low volatility

Algorithm:
1. Loop:
   Loop indefinitely:
      a. Get historical prices:
         historical_prices = GetHistoricalPrices(n)

      b. Calculate volatility:
         volatility = CalculateVolatility(historical_prices)

      c. Get the current price:
         current_price = GetCurrentPrice()

      d. Generate trading signals:
         If volatility > upper_threshold:
            GenerateSellSignal()
         Else if volatility < lower_threshold:
            GenerateBuySignal()

      e. Repeat the loop

2. End

Subroutine GetHistoricalPrices(n):
1. Retrieve historical price data for the past n periods from the trading platform or data provider
2. Return the historical prices as an array

Subroutine CalculateVolatility(prices):
1. Calculate the standard deviation of prices as a measure of volatility
2. Return the volatility value

Subroutine GetCurrentPrice():
1. Retrieve the current price from the trading platform or data provider
2. Return the current price

Subroutine GenerateBuySignal():
1. Execute the buy trade based on your trading platform's API or logic
2. Add appropriate risk management measures (position sizing, stop-loss, etc.)
3. Return

Subroutine GenerateSellSignal():
1. Execute the sell trade based on your trading platform's API or logic
2. Add appropriate risk management measures (position sizing, stop-loss, etc.)
3. Return
