Define:
- n: Number of periods for calculating pair statistics
- z_score_threshold: Threshold for z-score to trigger trading signals
- pair: A pair of correlated stocks or assets

Algorithm:
1. Loop:
   Loop indefinitely:
      a. Get historical prices for the pair:
         historical_prices_pair = GetHistoricalPrices(pair, n)

      b. Calculate pair statistics:
         mean = CalculateMean(historical_prices_pair)
         standard_deviation = CalculateStandardDeviation(historical_prices_pair)

      c. Get the current prices for the pair:
         current_prices_pair = GetCurrentPrices(pair)

      d. Calculate z-scores:
         z_scores = CalculateZScores(current_prices_pair, mean, standard_deviation)

      e. Generate trading signals:
         If z_scores > z_score_threshold:
            GenerateSellSignal(pair)
         Else if z_scores < -z_score_threshold:
            GenerateBuySignal(pair)

      f. Repeat the loop

2. End

Subroutine GetHistoricalPrices(pair, n):
1. Retrieve historical price data for the past n periods for the given pair from the trading platform or data provider
2. Return the historical prices as arrays for each stock or asset in the pair

Subroutine CalculateMean(prices):
1. Calculate the mean of prices
2. Return the mean value

Subroutine CalculateStandardDeviation(prices):
1. Calculate the standard deviation of prices
2. Return the standard deviation value

Subroutine GetCurrentPrices(pair):
1. Retrieve the current prices for each stock or asset in the given pair from the trading platform or data provider
2. Return the current prices as an array for the pair

Subroutine CalculateZScores(prices, mean, standard_deviation):
1. Calculate the z-scores for each stock or asset in the pair using the current prices, mean, and standard deviation
2. Return the z-scores as an array

Subroutine GenerateBuySignal(pair):
1. Execute the buy trade for the pair based on your trading platform's API or logic
2. Add appropriate risk management measures (position sizing, stop-loss, etc.)
3. Return

Subroutine GenerateSellSignal(pair):
1. Execute the sell trade for the pair based on your trading platform's API or logic
2. Add appropriate risk management measures (position sizing, stop-loss, etc.)
3. Return
